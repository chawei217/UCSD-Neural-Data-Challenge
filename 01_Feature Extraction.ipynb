The BCI Competition IV 2b is a motor imagery dataset with eye artifact data, making it a very realistic dataset. The subjects are prompted to imagine left vs right hand movement and the EEG + EOG signals for each trial are collected. We here have provided a simpler version of the dataset in CSV format for you to get started with. \n","\n","This notebook will help you get a better understanding of the techniques used to preprocess and extract features from EEG data.
